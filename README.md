# DemoJPASystem

This project was created for an assignment for University. It demonstrates the use of the Java Persistence Api to save, persist and retrieve data to and from a Derby database. This program runs and saves test data in the database and then retreives the same data and displays it to the user. This program requires Maven and Derby.
